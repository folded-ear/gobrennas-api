# Because of a weakness in the loader, conversions may only reference units
# which are listed earlier in the file. So be careful.
#
# `pluralName` is defaulted to `name` with a trailing "s". If that's not how to
# pluralize, supply the key explicitly.
#
# Removal of aliases and conversions is not supported by the loader. Addition of
# new aliases and conversions is supported. Updating existing conversions with a
# new factor is also supported.

# Renaming or removal of units is not supported by the loader.
